# RSPE ( Remote Shell and Python Execution )

## About RSPE 

RSPE is an ethical hacking tool that uses python's socket library to connect to remote pcs which have the client installed on them.

This tool allows you to execute remote shell commands and python scripts on the connected pc.

This program is not specific to python and might change to other languages as well, like c++, for example.

## How Does it WORK? 

### The IDEA behind RSPE

This program is NOT a reverse shell.

while at night, i got an idea, if the client can connect to the server at any point of time in reverse shell, and the server HAS firewall, it can still access it right? (thats reverse shell)

so that is limited only when the server is active.

what if whenever the client (remote) computer is up and online, the client hosts the server and the (attacker) can connect to it anytime he/she/it wants
